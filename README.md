# pdfQuestionExtractor
This set of code uses <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/">pdf.js</a> to extract text out of Pdf files, specifically Pdf files that contain quiz questions either at the end of a chapter (or elsewhere), so its "sister" repo quiz_creator can create javascript/html quizzes from the questions and answers.
